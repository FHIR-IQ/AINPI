# Magic Scanner: AI Provider Comparison

## Overview

The Magic Scanner supports two AI providers for discovering provider directories and their APIs:
1. **Perplexity AI** (default) - Web search AI with built-in citations
2. **OpenAI GPT-4o** - Advanced reasoning with general knowledge

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Perplexity AI (Sonar Pro) | OpenAI (GPT-4o) |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Web Search** | ✅ Built-in, real-time | ❌ Knowledge cutoff (Jan 2025) |
| **Citations** | ✅ Automatic web sources | ❌ No citations |
| **Cost per Scan** | ~$0.005 (cheaper) | ~$0.01-0.02 (2-4x more expensive) |
| **Accuracy** | High for current data | High for reasoning |
| **Response Time** | 10-15 seconds | 5-10 seconds (faster) |
| **Best For** | Finding current APIs | Structured data parsing |

## Configuration

Set the `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable in Vercel or `.env.local`:

```bash
# Use Perplexity (default)
AI_PROVIDER=perplexity
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Or use OpenAI
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

If `AI_PROVIDER` is not set, it defaults to `perplexity`.

## Switching Between Providers

### In Vercel (Production)

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Update `AI_PROVIDER` value:
   - Set to `perplexity` or `openai`
4. Ensure the corresponding API key is set:
   - For Perplexity: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
   - For OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
5. Redeploy or wait for next deployment

### In Local Development

1. Edit `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   # Switch to Perplexity
   AI_PROVIDER=perplexity
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-key

   # Or switch to OpenAI
   AI_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
   ```

2. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Response Format Differences

### Perplexity Response
```json
{
  "text": "JSON array of organizations...",
  "citations": [
    "https://www.sentara.com/api-docs",
    "https://www.anthem.com/developers",
    "https://www.cms.gov/regulations"
  ],
  "provider": "perplexity",
  "model": "sonar-pro"
}
```

### OpenAI Response
```json
{
  "text": "JSON array of organizations...",
  "citations": [],  // Always empty
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o"
}
```

## Recommendations

### Use Perplexity When:
- ✅ You need current, real-time information
- ✅ Web citations are important for verification
- ✅ Cost optimization is a priority
- ✅ You're scanning new or frequently changing organizations
- ✅ Regulatory compliance requires source verification

### Use OpenAI When:
- ✅ Speed is more important than current data
- ✅ You're scanning well-known, stable organizations
- ✅ You already have OpenAI credits/subscription
- ✅ You're in a region without Perplexity access
- ✅ Citations are not required for your use case

## Testing Both Providers

To compare both providers with the same data:

1. **Set up both API keys** in Vercel environment variables
2. **Run first scan with Perplexity:**
   ```bash
   AI_PROVIDER=perplexity
   ```
   - Note: Organizations found, API endpoints, response time
   - Save the citations for verification

3. **Run second scan with OpenAI:**
   ```bash
   AI_PROVIDER=openai
   ```
   - Compare: Organizations found, API endpoints, response time
   - Note: Any differences in data

4. **Compare results:**
   - Did both find the same organizations?
   - Which found more API endpoints?
   - Was Perplexity's data more current?
   - Was OpenAI faster?

## Example Logs

### Perplexity Log Output

```

## Fallback Strategy

For maximum reliability, you can set up a fallback:

```typescript
// In route.ts - Example fallback logic (not currently implemented)
let aiResponse;
try {
  aiResponse = await callAIProvider(prompt, systemPrompt);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Primary AI provider (${AI_PROVIDER}) failed, trying fallback...`);
  // Switch to alternative provider
  const fallbackProvider = AI_PROVIDER === 'perplexity' ? 'openai' : 'perplexity';
  aiResponse = await callAIProvider(prompt, systemPrompt, fallbackProvider);
}
```

This is not currently implemented but could be added for production resilience.

## Conclusion

**Default Choice: Perplexity AI**
- Best for most use cases
- Real-time web search
- Lower cost
- Provides citations

**Alternative: OpenAI GPT-4o**
- Use for faster responses
- Good for known organizations
- Better JSON structure reliability
- No citations needed

Both providers work seamlessly with the Magic Scanner's 3-step process. The choice depends on your priorities: **current data + citations** (Perplexity) vs **speed + cost flexibility** (OpenAI).
